Data Analytics Leader with a diverse background in management and hands-on experience in end-to-end data processes. My career has been defined by an unwavering commitment to delivering tangible business results through data-driven strategies and solutions. With expertise in AWS cloud services and streaming data stacks, I have consistently driven innovation and efficiency in data management, transformation, and analysis.

I demonstrate a strong business acumen and a focused commitment to achieving measurable results. I understand that data analytics is not an end in itself but a means to drive innovation, optimize processes, and increase profitability.

I have a deep understanding of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and its services, especially those related to data. I have worked with Athena, Redshift, Glue, Lambda, Kinesis, EC2, S3, API Gateway, Lambda, EKS, MSK, IAM, Cloudwatch, and others, as well as various languages including SQL, dotnet, Python, and bash. I have a proven track record of architecting and optimizing solutions on AWS, ensuring scalability, security, and cost efficiency.

With hands-on experience across the entire data lifecycle, I am ready to handle data from acquisition and transformation to analysis and reporting. This comprehensive understanding allows me to create robust data strategies that align with business objectives.

## Experience

___

> ### Data Team Lead
>
> **Kovi**
> *São Paulo, Brazil*
> Apr/2022 - Current

As Data Team Lead at Kovi, I managed a team of analysts and data scientists to ensure best practices and metrics across all areas of the company. My role was crucial in enhancing data governance and quality, as well as driving the transformation of raw data into valuable data products.

- Developed a star schema-based data modeling architecture, creating specific data marts for business areas. This design enabled more concise and efficient analysis, transforming raw data into actionable data products that support decision-making.
- Ensured the quality and governance of the company's data, establishing standards and practices that ensure data integrity and reliability throughout its lifecycle.
- Implemented a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) system using GitHub Actions, decoupling Airflow from data analysis. This allowed data and orchestration teams to focus on their areas of expertise, optimizing the development and maintenance of data pipelines.
- Led the hiring and training of a team of analysts and data scientists, ensuring the continuous development of technical and analytical skills needed to meet the company's objectives.
- Directed the definition of a standardized data layer (golden layer) based on star schema, enabling more accurate and consistent analysis and metrics across all areas of Kovi.
- Collaborated with executive and operational teams to understand their data needs and provide insights that drive the company's strategy and operations.

> ### Data Engineer/Scientist
>
> **Kovi**
> *São Paulo, Brazil*
> Oct/2019 - Apr/2022 [2 years 7 months]

At Kovi, I expanded my knowledge in Big Data, cloud applications, and data architecture. Working with a terabyte-sized data lake, I enhanced my skills in scalable systems and data solution development.

- Developed and implemented a data pipeline on AWS, from ingestion to analysis availability. The pipeline was designed to process and store data on a large scale, ensuring reliability and efficiency.
- Data Ingestion: Used Airflow for active API ingestion, AWS DMS for capturing database changes (CDC), and a combination of API Gateway and Kubernetes for passive ingestion of services and notifications.
- Data Stream: Implemented Bronze and Silver topics in Kafka Kinesis to store raw data in JSON and transformed data in Avro, respectively.
- Data Storage: Data was stored in layers in S3: Bronze (JSON), Silver (Parquet), and Golden (Iceberg).
- Materialization System: Used Airflow for scheduling and Athena/Starburst for processing, transforming data from the Silver layer to the Golden layer.
- Disponibilization: Data was made available through a query engine (Starburst/Redshift) and a data catalog (Glue Data Catalog), enabling analytical queries and integration with BI tools like Qlik and Metabase.
- Responsible for hiring and training a team of analysts and data scientists.
- Developed an AI to predict the probability of accidents for drivers based on driving behavior.
- Created and maintained business metrics, KPIs, and control panels, including the company's financial closing.

> ### Engineer/Dev/Founder
>
> **ceCosmos**
> *Florianópolis, Brazil*
> Oct/2017 - Oct/2019

At ceCosmos I faced my greatest personal and professional challenge, leading a diverse team and meeting the dynamic needs of the company. It was a journey of constant learning and innovation in technology and management.

- Developed a Flask API running on an EC2 instance of AWS, under the API Gateway, to implement a genetic algorithm artificial intelligence for process optimization. This API, written in Python, allowed the integration and scalability of the algorithm in different industrial contexts.
- Created a serverless microservice for solvent system simulation, running on AWS Lambda and written in C#. This service allowed the modeling of solvent behavior in chemical processes, aiming to optimize resource use and reduce operational costs.
- Developed a React web application running on an EC2 instance of AWS, under the API Gateway, to serve as the usage interface for the implemented artificial intelligences. This web application allowed the execution of complex simulations and process optimization in real time, with a user-friendly and interactive interface.
- Established direct contact with clients from the paint and solvent industries for requirements gathering and sales, using communication and negotiation skills to understand client needs and offer customized solutions.
- Managed the company's financial administration and control, using financial management tools to monitor cash flows, budgets, and financial performance, ensuring the sustainability and growth of the business.
